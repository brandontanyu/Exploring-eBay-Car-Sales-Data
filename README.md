## HELPING ETS KATS Trucks WITH CAR SALES DATA

####  Introduction 

**ETS KATS Trucks**  is a Cameroonian based company specialized in the purchase of automotive equipments ranging from cars, trucks, construction equipments and spare parts from all European brands. This company is new to the market and needs to ubderstand how the market functions.

We know just little about the  competitors in the market, but we are aware that ***eBay Kleinanzeigen***, the car used section of the German eBay website, is fairly popular, and extracting the data from it is easier than from other private selling competitors.

After some carefull research, a data set was found [here](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data), containing 50,000 data points. This data set will be analysed to provide useful insights for the newbie company.

The data so obtained has the following structure:
